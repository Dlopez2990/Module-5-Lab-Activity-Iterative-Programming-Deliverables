# Module-5-Lab-Activity-Iterative-Programming-Deliverables
Python program solutions to the following 5 problems.
For problems 1-5 we are given a set of problems that are similar but different from our last assessment.
Such as Problem 1 – Consider a program that prints “Hello World” to the screen 100 times.
Or like Problem 2 where we have to assume a list of numbers 12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20.
Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.
Below are the programs for all 5 problems.
