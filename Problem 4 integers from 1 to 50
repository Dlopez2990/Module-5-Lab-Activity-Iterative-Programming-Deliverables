# Problem 4 - Divisible by Three, Five, or Both
# This program iterates the integers from 1 to 50.
# For multiples of three, it prints "Divisible by three" instead of the number.
# For multiples of five, it prints "Divisible by five" instead of the number.
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "Divisible by both".
